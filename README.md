# Mixed Madlib integration

## codecademy-mixedmessages

---

Project from Codecademy's Backend Learning Path.
A mixed message generator program that outputs randomized output everytime it runs.

A simple console application with a base story of missing elements, that generates text filler to complete the story such as adjectives, nouns, verbs etc.. This may end up not making much sense, but if you're lucky, could create some good laughs. I used to love Madlibs growing up and I so I wanted to challenge myself for this project to use the random generation criteria in creating a madlib-like story.

### How its structured:

---

- The data that is manipulated is inserted into the story inside '{}'. Formatting was a challange and I ended up making it work with a now specific format - The fillers are capitilized with no spaces eg. {PLURALNOUN}, or {VERBING} etc.
- To add to the challenge, I added some import/export with a seperate data file.
- I found a decent madlibs site for my stories, with only 2 examples initially. Structure was important and I came across The Word Finder, so thanks to them for the layout and the stories. May add some more in the future. <a href="https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/" target="_blank">The Word Finder</a>
